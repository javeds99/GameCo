# GameCo

This project aimed to use data from GameCo's database to find insights that would help development of new games. Stakeholders had questions they needed to be answered, which were:

- Are certain types of games more popular than others?
- What are the main publishers  in each market?
- Have any games decreased or increased in popularity overtime?
- How have sale figures varied through different regions over time?
